# Clone this repo to get started! :)

# 1. Create a branch from `master`
In your local development environment pull down the newly created branch:

After your local machine is in sync with the repository switch over to your new branch:
$ git checkout yourbranch

Start developing your feature on this branch.

# 2. Create a pull request on Github
Once you have pushed all of your new code to your branch navigate to Github and open a pull request stating you want to merge your branch with the develop branch. Someone will review and approve the merge to the develop branch.
